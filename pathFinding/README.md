# Implementation of pathfinding algorithms in C++

The code implements pathfinding algorithms - Astar, Greedy and Uniform search - in C++. The algorithms helps to find the path from source to destination in the given graph. The Longitude and Latitude of a location are used as heuristics for calculating the path.

How to compile:
g++ -o SearchUSA SearchUSA.cpp

How to run:
./SearchUSA [algo type] [source] [destination]

e.g. ./SearchUSA astar fresno buffalo
